          <span>OUR GOALS</span><br><br><br>
          &#x201C; Undernourishment means that a person is unable to acquire enough food to meet the daily minimum
          dietary
          energy requirements. Food and Agriculture Organization defines hunger as being synonymous with chronic
          undernourishment. India has been growing steadily richer in recent years, but it still has more
          malnourished people, especially children, than any other country. And, this situation has dire outcomes
          over time. <br><br>

          The risks of mortality are significantly higher for children with stunted growth and wasting and other
          forms of undernutrition. Sometimes, deficiencies of specific nutrients, such as zinc, iron or vitamins
          can increase the risk of death or other serious ailments. In addition to mortality risks, malnourishment
          among children can have severe consequences in their long term development. <br><br>

          On a broader picture, hunger and malnourishment lead to reduced school attendance and educational
          milestones leading to lower literacy among poor students. People with undernourishment in their early
          years have been noticed to be under-performers in education and career over the years. Furthermore,
          studies have identified that stunting is a predictor of grade failure. <br> <br>

          Our vision is to serve nutritious and sanctified high quality
          food to the underprivileged children in India.&#x201C;
